# Road-Accident-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This repository contains code and resources for the Road Accident Prediction project using Machine Learning. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can predict the likelihood of road accidents based on various factors and help in implementing preventive measures.

# Problem Statement

As the number of accidents all over the world are increasing day by day, and the accurate predictions related to the severity of the accidents can be beneficial informations for emergency responders to evaluate the severity level of accidents, the potential impacts of accidents and to implement efficient accident management procedures.

# Dataset
Source:  https://www.narcis.nl/dataset/RecordID/oai%3Aeasy.dans.knaw.nl%3Aeasy-dataset%3A191591
This data set is collected from Addis Ababa Sub city police departments for Masters research work. The data set has been prepared from manual records of road traffic accident of the year 2017-20. All the sensitive information have been excluded during data encoding and finally it has 32 features and 12316 instances of the accident. Then it is preprocessed and for identification of major causes of the accident by analyzing it using different machine learning  classification algorithms algorithms. RTA Dataset.csv is the dataset before preprocessing.
