# RoadAccidentSeverityPrediction
In my project, I developed a predictive model for assessing accident severity by utilizing essential features. The model was created by implementing Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine algorithms, Gradient Boosting and XGBoost which were subsequently integrated using ensemble techniques.
